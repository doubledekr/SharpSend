# Voice Preservation Implementation

## Technical Implementation of Writer Voice Analysis

### Voice Profile Extraction Algorithm

```typescript
interface WriterVoiceProfile {
  tone: 'formal' | 'casual' | 'authoritative' | 'conversational';
  complexity: {
    avgSentenceLength: number;
    technicalTermDensity: number;
    readingLevel: number;
  };
  vocabulary: {
    keyPhrases: string[];
    preferredTransitions: string[];
    signatureExpressions: string[];
  };
  structure: {
    paragraphLength: 'short' | 'medium' | 'long';
    listUsage: number;
    questionFrequency: number;
  };
  personality: 'data-driven' | 'opinion-based' | 'balanced' | 'educational';
}
```

### AI Prompt Engineering for Cohort Adaptation

#### Professional Investors Prompt Template:
```
You are adapting financial content while preserving the writer's authentic voice.

ORIGINAL VOICE ANALYSIS:
- Tone: ${voiceProfile.tone}
- Avg sentence length: ${voiceProfile.complexity.avgSentenceLength} words
- Key phrases: ${voiceProfile.vocabulary.keyPhrases.join(', ')}
- Writing style: ${voiceProfile.personality}

ADAPTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Target: Professional investors requiring institutional-grade analysis
- Add: Specific metrics, sector rotation data, technical indicators
- Preserve: Original tone, paragraph structure, signature expressions
- Enhance: Technical depth while maintaining writer's natural style

CONTENT TO ADAPT:
${originalContent}

VOICE PRESERVATION RULES:
1. Keep the writer's opening style and transitions
2. Maintain signature phrases and expressions  
3. Preserve paragraph flow and structure
4. Match original sentence complexity patterns
5. Use the writer's established vocabulary base
```

#### Learning Investors Prompt Template:
```
ADAPTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Target: Beginner investors needing educational context
- Add: Explanations of terms, basic concepts, step-by-step guidance
- Preserve: Writer's natural personality and tone
- Simplify: Complex concepts without losing authenticity

EDUCATIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
- Define technical terms in parentheses
- Add "what this means" explanatory sentences
- Include practical examples
- Maintain writer's encouraging/authoritative voice
```

## Voice Consistency Validation

### Automated Voice Drift Detection
```typescript
class VoiceConsistencyValidator {
  calculateDriftScore(original: string, adapted: string): number {
    const metrics = {
      toneShift: this.measureToneConsistency(original, adapted),
      vocabularyDrift: this.compareVocabulary(original, adapted),
      structureDeviation: this.analyzeStructuralChanges(original, adapted),
      personalityPreservation: this.validatePersonality(original, adapted)
    };
    
    return (metrics.toneShift + metrics.vocabularyDrift + 
            metrics.structureDeviation + metrics.personalityPreservation) / 4;
  }
  
  // Reject if drift > 30%
  isAcceptable(driftScore: number): boolean {
    return driftScore < 0.3;
  }
}
```

### Quality Assurance Workflow
1. **Initial Voice Analysis**: Extract profile from original content
2. **AI Generation**: Create cohort-specific versions with voice constraints
3. **Automated Validation**: Check voice drift score
4. **Rejection/Approval**: Auto-reject if drift > 30%
5. **Editorial Review**: Human verification of approved versions
6. **Learning Loop**: Update voice profile based on approved adaptations

## Real-World Voice Preservation Examples

### Example Writer: "The Market Observer" (Casual, Opinion-Based)

**Original Content:**
"Here's the thing about this week's Fed decision - it's not just about rates, it's about what Powell isn't saying. The bond market is telling us one story, but if you look deeper into the yield curve, there's something else brewing."

**Professional Adaptation (Voice Preserved):**
"Here's the thing about this week's Fed decision - it's not just about the 25bp hold, it's about Powell's forward guidance gaps. The bond market is pricing in terminal rates at 4.75%, but if you look deeper into the 2s10s spread compression to 67bp, there's institutional positioning suggesting a different scenario."

**Learning Adaptation (Voice Preserved):**
"Here's the thing about this week's Fed decision - it's not just about interest rates staying the same, it's about what Fed Chairman Powell isn't telling us. The bond market (where governments borrow money) is telling us one story, but if you look deeper into the yield curve (how different bonds pay different rates), there's something else brewing that affects your investments."

### Voice Characteristics Preserved:
- Opening: "Here's the thing about..."
- Conversational tone maintained
- Opinion-based perspective ("it's about what he isn't saying")
- Structure: Setup → contrast → deeper insight
- Personality: Confident, insider knowledge approach

## Implementation in SharpSend Architecture

### Enhanced Email Sharpening Service
```typescript
class VoicePreservingEmailSharpener {
  async sharpenWithVoicePreservation(
    originalContent: string,
    cohortTarget: CohortType,
    writerProfile?: WriterVoiceProfile
  ): Promise<SharpenedEmail> {
    
    // Extract or use cached voice profile
    const voiceProfile = writerProfile || 
      await this.extractVoiceProfile(originalContent);
    
    // Generate cohort-specific adaptation
    const sharpenedContent = await this.generateAdaptation(
      originalContent, 
      cohortTarget, 
      voiceProfile
    );
    
    // Validate voice consistency
    const driftScore = this.validator.calculateDriftScore(
      originalContent, 
      sharpenedContent
    );
    
    if (!this.validator.isAcceptable(driftScore)) {
      // Regenerate with stronger voice constraints
      return this.regenerateWithStrongerConstraints(
        originalContent, 
        cohortTarget, 
        voiceProfile
      );
    }
    
    return {
      content: sharpenedContent,
      voiceConsistencyScore: 1 - driftScore,
      cohortTarget,
      preservedElements: this.identifyPreservedElements(voiceProfile)
    };
  }
}
```

This ensures that regardless of cohort targeting sophistication, each email maintains the authentic voice that subscribers chose to follow while delivering optimally relevant content for their investment profile.
