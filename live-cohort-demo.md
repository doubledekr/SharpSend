## How Cohort Detection Works

### 1. Data Analysis from Mailchimp
SharpSend processes these behavioral signals:
- **Email Engagement**: Open rates, click rates, time-to-click
- **Content Preferences**: Which links clicked, subject line response
- **Timing Patterns**: When subscribers engage with emails
- **Device Usage**: Mobile vs desktop engagement
- **Geographic Data**: Location-based timing preferences

### 2. AI Behavioral Clustering
The system identifies patterns like:
- **High Engagement + Fast Response = Professional Traders**
- **Moderate Engagement + Educational Clicks = Learning Investors**  
- **Consistent Patterns + Income Focus = Conservative Income**
- **Volatility Response + Growth Clicks = Growth Investors**

### 3. Dynamic Segmentation
Cohorts update automatically as behavior changes:
- Subscribers can move between cohorts
- System learns from market responses
- Seasonal pattern recognition
- Investment style evolution tracking

## Mailchimp Integration Process

### Step 1: Automatic Tag Creation
When cohorts are detected, SharpSend creates these Mailchimp tags:
- `SS_Professional_Investors` (50 subscribers)
- `SS_Learning_Investors`
- `SS_Income_Focused` 
- `SS_Growth_Investors`
- `SS_Conservative_Investors`

### Step 2: Subscriber Tagging
Each subscriber automatically gets tagged based on AI analysis:
- Email: investor@example.com â†’ Tag: SS_Professional_Investors
- Behavior analysis determines appropriate cohort
- Tags update as behavior patterns change

### Step 3: Campaign Deployment
For each newsletter, SharpSend creates 5 Mailchimp campaigns:

**Campaign 1: "Weekly Update - Professional Focus"**
