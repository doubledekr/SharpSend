### Weekly Content Creation Process

#### Step 1: Editorial Assignment
**Editor Request via SharpSend Dashboard:**
```
Content Type: Weekly Market Brief
Target Cohorts: Professional, Learning, Income-focused (3 of 5 allowed)
Market Context: Fed decision week, earnings season
Voice Profile: Casual, opinion-based (established writer profile)
Deadline: Tuesday 4 PM EST
```

#### Step 2: Copywriter Creation
**Original Content (Written Once):**
```
Subject: Fed Week Reality Check

Here's the thing about this week's Fed decision - it's not just about 
rates, it's about what Powell isn't saying. 

The bond market is telling us one story, but if you look deeper into 
the yield curve, there's something else brewing. I've been tracking 
the 2s10s spread, and institutional money is positioning for something 
different than the headlines suggest.

Three things to watch:
• Regional bank stress indicators
• Credit market divergence  
• Sector rotation patterns

Bottom line: This isn't your typical Fed week. Smart money is already 
moving, and retail investors are about to get caught off-guard again.

What this means for your portfolio...

Subject: Fed Week Reality Check: 2s10s Spread Signals Divergence

Here's the thing about this week's FOMC decision - it's not just about 
the 25bp hold, it's about Powell's forward guidance gaps on terminal 
rates.

The bond market is pricing in 4.75% terminal, but if you look deeper 
into the yield curve inversion at 67bp, there's institutional positioning 
suggesting a different scenario. I've been tracking the 2s10s spread 
compression alongside TGA drawdowns, and institutional flow data shows 
asymmetric positioning for a potential pivot.

Three institutional indicators to monitor:
• KBW regional bank index relative performance vs. SPX  
• IG/HY credit spread differentials (currently 580bp)
• Sector rotation into defensives (XLU +2.3% this week)

Bottom line: This isn't your typical 25bp hold. Smart money flow shows 
$2.1B rotating into duration trades, and retail sentiment surveys 
suggest complacency before potential volatility expansion.

What this means for your institutional positioning...

Subject: Fed Week Reality Check: What It Really Means

Here's the thing about this week's Fed decision - it's not just about 
interest rates staying the same, it's about what Fed Chairman Powell 
isn't telling us directly.

The bond market (where the government borrows money) is telling us one 
story, but if you look deeper into something called the yield curve 
(how different bonds pay different rates), there's something else brewing. 
I've been tracking the spread between 2-year and 10-year bonds, and 
big institutional investors are positioning for something different 
than the headlines suggest.

Three simple things to watch:
• Regional bank performance (smaller banks are often affected first)
• Credit market changes (how easy/expensive it is to borrow)
• Money moving between different sectors

Bottom line: This isn't your typical Fed week. Smart money (professional 
investors) is already moving, and regular retail investors (like most 
of us) are about to get caught off-guard again.

What this means for your beginner portfolio...
