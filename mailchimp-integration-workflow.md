# SharpSend + Mailchimp Integration Workflow

## How SharpSend Works with Your Existing Mailchimp Account

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Data Sync (Day 1)

**Step 1: Connect Your Mailchimp Account**

**Step 2: Automatic Cohort Detection** 
- SharpSend analyzes your existing Mailchimp data to identify behavioral patterns:
  - **Professional Investors**: High engagement, clicks on technical content links
  - **Learning Investors**: Lower engagement, clicks on educational content

  - **Conservative Investors**: Engages with stability-focused content

**Step 3: Market Intelligence Integration**
- System connects to financial data APIs (MarketAux, Polygon) 
- Creates real-time market context for content personalization
- No additional setup required from user

### Phase 2: Content Creation Workflow (Ongoing)

3. Get average 15-25% open rates, 2-5% click rates

**New SharpSend-Enhanced Process:**

**Step 1: Write Your Base Content**
