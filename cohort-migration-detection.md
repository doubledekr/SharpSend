# SharpSend Individual & Micro-Cohort Migration Detection

## Individual Subscriber Migration Tracking

SharpSend continuously monitors each subscriber's behavioral evolution and can detect when someone needs to move between cohorts, even at the individual level.

### Real-Time Behavioral Signals

**Engagement Pattern Changes:**
- Sudden increase in open rates (Learning → Professional transition)
- Shift in click timing (Conservative → Growth investor behavior)
- Content preference evolution (Income → Growth focus)
- Response to market volatility (Risk tolerance changes)

**Market Response Indicators:**
- How quickly they open emails during market events
- Which links they click during different market conditions
- Email engagement during earnings seasons vs calm periods
- Response to technical vs educational content

### Individual Migration Examples

**Case 1: Learning → Professional Transition**
- Subscriber: investor@example.com
- **Before**: 45% open rate, clicks educational links, slow response time
- **After**: 85% open rate, clicks technical analysis, fast response (<5 min)
- **Detection**: System flags behavioral shift after 3 consecutive emails
- **Action**: Auto-migrates from "SS_Learning_Investors" to "SS_Professional_Investors" tag

**Case 2: Conservative → Growth Migration**
- **Trigger**: Increased engagement during high volatility periods
- **Signal**: Clicks on growth stock analysis vs dividend content
- **Timeline**: Detected over 2-week behavioral change period
- **Result**: Subscriber receives growth-focused content instead of conservative positioning

**Case 3: Small Group Migration (3-5 subscribers)**
- **Pattern**: Group of income investors suddenly engaging with tech sector content
- **Detection**: AI identifies micro-cohort forming within larger segment  
- **Response**: Creates sub-segment "SS_Income_Tech_Interest" for targeted content

## Migration Detection Algorithm

### 1. Behavioral Scoring Matrix
Each subscriber has dynamic scores across multiple dimensions:
- **Investment Sophistication**: 1-10 scale (updates based on content engagement)
- **Risk Tolerance**: Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive (tracked via market response)
- **Content Complexity**: Preferred depth of analysis
- **Market Timing**: Response speed to market events
- **Sector Interests**: Evolving focus areas

### 2. Change Detection Triggers
**Immediate Flags (1-3 emails):**
- Dramatic engagement change (>50% difference)
- New content type engagement
- Significant timing behavior shift

**Trend Analysis (5-10 emails):**
- Gradual sophistication increase
- Evolving sector interests
- Risk tolerance adaptation

**Market Event Response:**
- How behavior changes during volatility
- Engagement with crisis/opportunity content
- Response to Fed announcements, earnings

### 3. Migration Validation
Before moving subscribers, system validates:
- **Consistency**: Pattern confirmed across multiple emails
- **Context**: Market conditions considered
- **Performance**: Will new cohort improve engagement?

## Micro-Cohort Formation

### Dynamic Sub-Segmentation
SharpSend can create specialized segments for small groups with unique characteristics:

**"Emerging Tech Income" (7 subscribers)**
- Income-focused but interested in tech dividends
- Gets dividend analysis with tech sector overlay
- Separate campaign: "Income Alert: Tech Dividend Opportunities"

**"Conservative Growth" (12 subscribers)**
- Growth interest but risk-averse
- Receives growth content with risk mitigation focus  
- Campaign: "Safe Growth: Low-Risk Expansion Plays"

**"Professional Day Traders" (4 subscribers)**

- Pre-market sends at 6:30 AM EST

## Mailchimp Integration for Migrations

### Automatic Tag Management
When migrations detected:
1. **Remove old tag**: "SS_Learning_Investors"
2. **Add new tag**: "SS_Professional_Investors"  
3. **Update campaign targeting**: Next email goes to appropriate cohort
4. **Historical tracking**: Migration logged for analysis

### Gradual Transition Process
**Soft Migration** (2-week period):
- Subscriber receives blend of old and new content
- System monitors response to confirm migration
- Full switch after validation

**Hard Migration** (immediate):
- Clear behavioral shift detected
- Immediate tag change and content adjustment
- Used for obvious sophistication jumps
